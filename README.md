# Database-Management-Portfolio

Hi, If you made it this far My name is Jordan Hayes and I'm aspiring to switch careers into it. 

I have a couple of Projects to share to show my knowledge of Database

1) the First one is a Games Database.

 I made a mistake so now I have to drop a column cause it's in the wrong table
 ALTER TABLE Games.Games DROP COLUMN List_Price;
 GO
